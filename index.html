      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This decision aid tool is designed to help users understand the public preferences for various vaccine mandate scenarios based on a Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) conducted in Australia, France, and Italy. By analysing the attributes and their levels, along with the estimated coefficients, this tool provides insights into how different factors influence the acceptance and uptake of vaccine mandates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="attributes">
      <h2>Attributes & Levels</h2>
      <p>
        The DCE was created around six key attributes, each with multiple levels. These attributes define the different characteristics of vaccine mandates that were evaluated for public preference.
      </p>

      <div class="attribute">
        <h3>1. Scope of Mandate</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>High-risk occupations only (Reference):</strong> Vaccines are required only for high-risk roles/occupations and individuals in settings such as healthcare workers and border protection workers.</li>
          <li><strong>All occupations and public spaces:</strong> Vaccines are required for all workplaces and public spaces, including entry into cinemas, restaurants, and malls.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="attribute">
        <h3>2. Infection Threshold for Mandate Activation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>50 cases per 100,000 people with a 10% weekly increase (Reference):</strong> Indicates a moderate strain on healthcare resources, beginning to pressure healthcare services with a hybrid schooling model in place.</li>
          <li><strong>100 cases per 100,000 people with a 15% weekly increase:</strong> Signifies a significant strain on the healthcare system, leading to delays in emergency services and considering remote operations for schools and businesses.</li>
          <li><strong>200 cases per 100,000 people with a 20% weekly increase:</strong> Represents a severe strain, with healthcare systems likely overwhelmed and widespread closures of schools, businesses, and public places.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="attribute">
        <h3>3. Vaccine Coverage Requirement for Lifting Mandates</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Low vaccine coverage (50%) (Reference):</strong> Mandates may be lifted if vaccination helps reduce outbreaks and lessen healthcare load, maintaining some public health measures.</li>
          <li><strong>Moderate vaccine coverage (70%):</strong> Mandates can be lifted once vaccination effectively reduces outbreak frequency, allowing most activities to resume safely with minimal precautions.</li>
          <li><strong>High vaccine coverage (90%):</strong> Mandates can be lifted as widespread vaccination significantly limits virus spread, allowing a full return to normal life without additional measures.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="attribute">
        <h3>4. Incentives/Benefits for Vaccination</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No incentives (Reference):</strong> Relies solely on mandates and sanctions to drive compliance, emphasising the public health benefits of vaccination.</li>
          <li><strong>Paid time off for vaccination (1-3 days):</strong> Offers between one and three days of paid leave for getting vaccinated, funded by the government to prevent income loss.</li>
          <li><strong>Government subsidy or discounts on government services:</strong> Provides a 10% discount on various government services, including passport renewal, public transportation fares, driver's license fees, and national park entry fees, valid for six months.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="attribute">
        <h3>5. Exemption Policy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Medical exemptions only (Reference):</strong> Exemptions granted solely based on medical grounds, verified by a licensed doctor.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical and religious exemptions:</strong> Allows exemptions for medical reasons and sincerely held religious beliefs.</li>
          <li><strong>Medical, religious exemptions, and broad personal belief:</strong> Includes exemptions for medical, religious, and a wider range of personal beliefs, such as philosophical objections.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="attribute">
        <h3>6. Financial Incentive Amount</h3>
        <p>
          The monetary reward offered to individuals for complying with the vaccine mandate. This is a continuous numerical attribute ranging from $0 to $500.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="coefficients">
      <h2>Coefficient Estimates</h2>
      <p>
        The following table presents the estimated coefficients (\(\beta\)) for each attribute level based on an Error Component Logit Model. These coefficients indicate the strength and direction of the preference for each attribute level.

      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> The coefficients indicate the impact of each attribute level on the utility of the vaccine mandate scenario. Positive values suggest a higher preference, while negative values indicate a lower preference.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mrs">
      <h2>Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)</h2>
      <p>
        The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS) quantifies the trade-offs respondents are willing to make between different attributes while maintaining the same level of utility. It helps in understanding how much of one attribute (e.g., Financial Incentive Amount) respondents are willing to give up to gain another attribute (e.g., Severity of Sanctions).
      </p>

      <canvas id="mrsChart" width="400" height="200"></canvas>

      <p>
        <strong>Calculation Example:</strong>
      </p>
      <pre>
\[
\text{MRS}_{\text{Sanctions}, \text{Financial Incentive Amount}} = -\frac{\beta_{\text{Sanctions}}}{\beta_{\text{Financial Incentive Amount}}}
\]
\[
\text{If } \beta_{\text{Sanctions}} = 0.8 \text{ and } \beta_{\text{Financial Incentive Amount}} = 0.5,
\]
\[
\text{MRS} = -\frac{0.8}{0.5} = -1.6
\]
\]
      </pre>
      <p>
        This means respondents are willing to forego $1.60 in financial incentives for each additional unit increase in the severity of sanctions for non-compliance.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        This decision aid tool has provided an overview of how different attributes and their levels influence public preferences for vaccine mandates. By analysing coefficient estimates and calculating the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS), we gain insights into the trade-offs that individuals are willing to make when considering various mandate designs. The uptake predictions offer a predictive glimpse into how different policy scenarios might perform in terms of public acceptance and compliance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Policymakers can utilise these insights to design vaccine mandates that align with public preferences, thereby enhancing compliance rates and ensuring the effectiveness of public health interventions. Future studies can expand upon this tool by incorporating more attributes, refining coefficient estimates, and utilising real-world data to continuously improve mandate designs.
